This is data encrption decryption application.

In here I'm going to tell how locally setup the this application.

After the installing the that mentioned softwares download my ransomeware folder and put it into the netbeans project folder.(C:\Users\chathuranga\Documents\NetBeansProjects) 

After that open netbeans and select the Ransomware application.
